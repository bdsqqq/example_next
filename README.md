The `JSON` data we talked about in the meeting is in the `/data` folder, it's a `.ts` file so we get type inference for it and are able to use default import/export syntax.

The `index.tsx` file imports the data from the file and uses it to create links for the pages that will be generated, while the `embed/[slug].tsx` file uses Next's getStaticPaths and getStaticProps to create pages using the markup defined in the file. Notice that the different pages have different content.
